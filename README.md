This project is inspired from [Ade-Mir](https://github.com/Ade-mir/html-css-js-portfolio-tutorial-2). Go check it out or see the [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU)!

Wael Yasmina provides great [tutorials]{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyAdWWZRNBY} and shares his [github repos](https://github.com/WaelYasmina/drivingquiz) on how to publish a website.

# Guide

Run ```npx parcel build ./src/index.html```
This will generate a ```dist``` folder. Open the index.html file inside the folder and add a ./ in front of all the paths. The contents of the ```dist``` folder are now the website.
